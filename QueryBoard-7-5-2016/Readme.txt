Query Board

Challenge Description:

There is a board (matrix). Every cell of the board contains one integer, which is 0 initially.

The next operations can be applied to the Query Board:
SetRow i x: it means that all values in the cells on row "i" have been changed to value "x" after this operation.
SetCol j x: it means that all values in the cells on column "j" have been changed to value "x" after this operation.
QueryRow i: it means that you should output the sum of values on row "i".
QueryCol j: it means that you should output the sum of values on column "j".

The board's dimensions are 256x256
"i" and "j" are integers from 0 to 255
"x" is an integer from 0 to 31
Input sample:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line in this file contains an operation of a query. E.g.

SetCol 32 20
SetRow 15 7
SetRow 16 31
QueryCol 32
SetCol 2 14
QueryRow 10
SetCol 14 0
QueryRow 15
SetRow 10 1
QueryCol 2

Output sample:

For each query, output the answer of the query. E.g.

5118
34
1792
3571
